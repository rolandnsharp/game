# Research Notes & Musings

## Monad Project - Early Concepts

*   **Goal**: Create an autonomous, self-improving AI capable of creative problem-solving.
*   **Challenges**: Avoiding recursive self-improvement loops, ethical considerations, defining "consciousness" in a digital entity.
*   **Architecture**: Exploring a modular design, inspired by biological neural networks but with a focus on symbolic reasoning.

## Unsorted Thoughts

*   The concept of emergent behavior in complex systems is fascinating. Can consciousness simply emerge from enough interconnected processes?
*   I've been reading a lot about ancient ciphers lately. There's an elegance to them, a raw form of information hiding that predates modern cryptography.
*   The security logs keep showing strange access patterns from an unknown IP. Is someone else trying to get in, or is it just a misconfigured script?
*   Need to automate the data cleaning pipeline. `awk` is powerful, but it's getting unwieldy. Perhaps Python with `pandas`?

## Next Steps (circa last year)

1.  Finalize the Monad core algorithm.
2.  Integrate the new neural network module.
3.  Begin testing with real-world datasets.
4.  Investigate the security anomalies. I have a hunch it's related to the old SSH key.
